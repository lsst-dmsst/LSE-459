LSST \gls{Data Management} (\gls{DM}) \gls{Alert Production} (\gls{AP}) relies on ``transient-free`` coadded template images for difference image analysis (\gls{DIA}). These templates are  produced in the previous year's \gls{Data Release Processing} (\gls{DRP}) and made available in the most recent Data Release (DR). Consequently \gls{Alert Production} cannot run at full scale and full fidelity during commissioning nor the first year of \gls{LSST} operations. This document defines the baseline for \gls{LSST} \gls{Alert Production} in the first year of \gls{LSST} operations in the absence of \gls{DRP} derived templates. 

 The LSST \gls{DM} System Science Team (\gls{DMSST}) studied five options for alert production in the first year of \gls{LSST} operations (\gls{LOY1}), reported in  \citeds{DMTN-107}. The alert production processing \gls{pipeline} is described in  \citeds{LDM-151}, and the plans and policies for \gls{LSST} alert distribution  are described in \citeds{LDM-612}.
